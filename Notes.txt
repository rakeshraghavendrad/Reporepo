Model Governance – 07/17/2025
	1.	In September, we can expect some updates to the prompt based on feedback from Ryan Leed.
	2.	The deployed model includes five categories. What changes can we expect? What is the final decision for the customer? For timeout cases, we excluded those where the customer was not in contact with the agent. The rest are considered “present,” excluding the timeout cases.
	3.	Feedback, including written responses from agents and AI analysis, was reviewed and summarized by Ryan.
	4.	Is there a possibility for Ryan to share the outcomes of the analysis?
	5.	Examples of evidence provided by agents were reviewed. It seems they pertain only to Apple.
	6.	Merchant-wise categorization (e.g., based on decision outcomes) was discussed.
	7.	Parvathi will send out the tracker Excel sheet across teams to ensure all members have access.
