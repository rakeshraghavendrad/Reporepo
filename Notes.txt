Log files should be maintained as separate files for each feature.

Splunk logs show processing errors still occurring. During test cases, processing was only 1 or 2 instances. The issue appears to be that the model armor blocks the Tachyon call. Additionally, some data in PDFs is being misinterpreted as credit card numbers. This needs to be corrected.

Mike to coordinate with the Tachyon team to investigate and resolve the processing error.

For the 19-claim process, agent notes to be captured for all 19 cases, if applicable.

Mike will verify the updated code in claims to gather feedback. The changes have already been implemented in the testing environment, and verification in the non-production environment is scheduled for Thursday. The claims team will provide the estimated time required for production fixes.
