I need your opinion , i am running DSPY to optimise prompt i have prompt at 7 component level where at 6 component the information are extracted from pdf and at 7 component level all the information are summarised and final verdict are given ... when i call the LLm at component level .. each component have their own system prompt when i run them separatly the final verdict the decisions are in line with SME decisions / Actual decisions .. which is 95% , BUT when i combine all the prompts and call the LLm once meaning .. i am calling the LLM only one time by stiching all the 7 components to one component ... in this case i am unable to land the accuracy of 95% insted i am getting 52% training accuracy and optimised as 76% , val accuracy as 56% & optimised model as 80% something is off ... why am i not able to land 95% initial predicted accuracy when i use stitch prompt becasue at component level its very high
