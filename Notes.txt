Subject: Clarification on Vertex AI Embeddings and Alternative Options

Hi Ryan,

Thanks for sharing the Gemini 1.2 model endpoints. I’ve started using them and am currently evaluating semantic similarity using RAGAS.

At the moment, I’m leveraging Vertex AI embeddings to compute sentence embeddings for scoring. However, I understand that using Vertex AI embeddings requires specific roles and access keys.

Looking ahead, I see that the model endpoints will start returning results in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, are there any alternative methods or workarounds to generate embeddings without relying on Vertex AI? If so, could you please share a sample implementation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
